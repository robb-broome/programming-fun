# The coin game is a game where a number of coins are put in a center "pot".
# Two players take turns where they can pick up 1, 2 or 4 coins from the pot.
# The winner is the player who takes the last coin(s) from the pot.
# Write a function that, given the number of coins in the center and the order
# of the players' turns, returns which player will win the game if they both
# play with optimal strategy
# Examples:
# coin_game(1, "alice", "bob") returns "alice"
# coin_game(3, "alice", "bob") returns "bob"
